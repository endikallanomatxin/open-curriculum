    <h2>Action plan</h2>
    <h3>Organization typology</h3>
    <p>As it could not be otherwise, I believe it is crucial to establish the organization as a non-profit foundation,
        similar to renowned entities like the Linux or Blender foundations. <s>Our soociety already depends too heavily
            in very few mastodontic corporations whose only real purpose is to maximize profit.</s></p>
    <p>The foundation will be responsible for the creation of the platform, its moderation and some of the development
        of the curriculum.</p>
    <p>Specifics on the foundation can be found in its statutes available in the website.</p>
    <h3>First steps</h3>
    <h4>Development of platform's core functionalities</h4>
    <p>The initial focus would be on developing the core functionalities of the platform.</p>
    <p>That would include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Defining system's infrastructure like servers, databases...</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Designing and developing the curriculum consumption user interface and functionality</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Designing and developing the curriculum creation user interface and functionality</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I estimate it will take a team of around 4 senior developers around 4 months (±50%) to get the basic
        functionalities of the platform working.</p>
    <p>At this point, closed creation on a the preliminary curriculum can start, while the rest of functionalities are
        being worked on and implemented.</p>
    <h4>Development of a preliminary curriculum and gradual open-sourcing</h4>
    <p>Before opening the platform to contributions from the open-source community, it is important to have a well
        structured preliminary structure in order to make development and coordination easier later on.</p>
    <p>During this phase, focus will primarily be on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Defining the structure of the curriculum graph: This entails identifying the most relevant units,
                determining their dependencies, and grouping them together effectively.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Identifying recommended bibliography for the units and groups, resulting in something like a bibliography
                tree.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Content will be once the preliminary structure is mostly clear.</p>
    <p>The process would start by contacting great professors, both from universities and online content creators.These
        would constitute the first set of users to have access to the platform. They will be responsible for the
        definition of the foundations for the universal open-source curriculum.</p>
    <p>The professors will be selected based on their reputation and visibility. It is inevitable that the group will be
        biased, with an overrepresentation of famous professors, and many excellent teachers may be left out. However,
        this approach is the best that can be done under the circumstances and it is just done to ensure a stable start.
        Later on, all professors will have access and the right to make the proposals they please.</p>
    <p>The inclusion of more users will be gradual, incorporating professors in rounds. With each new round recently
        joined professors will be allowed to recommend colleagues for the next round. This will enable the inclusion of
        additional exceptional professors who may have initially been overlooked.</p>
    <p>I estimate this will take around 6 months (±50%), considering it will be done by voluntaries that already have a
        pretty busy life.</p>
    <h3>Next steps</h3>
    <p>After those first steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Developers will continue adding further funcionatily to the platform, always listening to user feedback
                and needs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Universities will be contacted to stablish partnerships by integrating the curriculums into their
                subjects. This will promote its adoption and boost its development.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
