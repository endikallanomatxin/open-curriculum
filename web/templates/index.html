        <div class="qa">
            <p class="q">Is this trying to substitute universities?</p>
            <p class="a">No, the objective is to complement them, rather than substituting them. The system will be a tool for university professors to unite efforts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qa">
            <p class="q">What is the role of universities in this platform?</p>
            <p class="a">Universities remain the primary certifying entities. The platform proposes that universities adhere to the open-source curriculum, contribute to its development, and use the content in their classes. Students' certifications are recorded on the platform, creating a standardized and compatible certification system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qa">
            <p class="q">How is this different from other online learning platforms?</p>
            <p class="a">It stands out by offering a collaborative curriculum development system and by integrating with current universities, ensuring the recognition and compatibility of the education provided.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qa">
            <p class="q">How can individuals contribute to the collaborative development of the curriculum?</p>
            <p class="a">The platform encourages individuals to make proposals for changes to units or their dependencies. Proposals undergo a democratic voting process, and individuals can actively participate by voting and providing feedback. The collaborative nature of the platform allows for a diverse range of contributions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qa">
            <p class="q">What about the concerns of job displacement for traditional professors?</p>
            <p class="a">The platform aims to enhance, not replace, traditional teaching. If the platform is trying to optimize education and reduce costs, it is not to reduce the resources/investment, but to reach further; and professors will still play a crucial role in supervising tasks, providing feedback, and contributing to the collaborative curriculum.</p>
            En realidad, me gustar√≠a decir: 
            <p class="a">Unemployment is not a side effect of the platform, it is the main objective. Automation is always good if it the outcome is shared with all humanity.</p>
            Pero tengo que encontrar una forma elegante de decirlo sin que los profes se asusten.
